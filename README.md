# SignEase
I built a simple online tool to help people sign documents digitally, making it easier and faster for businesses to handle paperwork. This tool allows users to create, save, and download their electronic signatures, so they donâ€™t have to sign every document from scratch.

# Main Features:

Create and Save Signatures:
Users can easily create their signature and save it for future use. This saves time when signing multiple documents.

Personalization:
Users can change the thickness and color of their signature to make it look the way they want. This makes the tool more flexible and personal.

Quick Signature Access:
I built a system that lets users quickly access their saved signatures, helping them complete their work faster and with less effort.

Works on All Browsers:
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the tool, making sure it works smoothly on all web browsers, so users can sign documents from any device.

Impact:
This tool makes signing documents online easy and efficient. It saves time, helps people personalize their signatures, and speeds up the document workflow for businesses.
